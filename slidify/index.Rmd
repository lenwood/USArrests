### Introduction

With data from the *1975 World Almanac* and *Statistical Abstracts of the United States*, the [USArrests](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/USArrests.html) data set within the R [datasets](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) package brings together 1973 data on Assault, Rape & Murder arrests by state.<br /><br />

The USArrests data set is a data frame with 4 variables for each state:
 - **Assault** - number of Assault arrests per 100,000 people.
 - **Rape** - number of Rape arrests per 100,000 people.
 - **UrbanPop** - percentage of urban population.
 - **Murder** - number of Murder arrests per 100,000 people.

### App Instructions

Using RStudio's [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) package, I have created an interactive chart to view this data by state.<br /><br />

I chose this data set for the challenge of creating a choropleth, and because the data is easily accessible to R (this package is included in a standard R installation).

I have created an interactive page which does 3 things:
  1. US map updates with data on the selected crime.
  2. Calculates the average & standard deviation of the data presented.
  3. Provides an interactive table to easily view the data.

### Urban Population Histogram

The USArrests data set contains one variable which I chose not to include. I'll include it here.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
data(USArrests); urbanPop <- USArrests$UrbanPop
hist(urbanPop, xlab="Urban Population Percentage", freq=FALSE, 
     col="lightgreen", xlim=c(15, 115), ylim=c(0, 0.03))
curve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(urbanPop), sd=sd(urbanPop)), add=TRUE, 
      col="darkblue", lwd=2)
```

### Conclusion

My app is located at [lenwood.shinyapps.io/USArrests](https://lenwood.shinyapps.io/USArrests/).<br /><br />

To use the web app, select a given crime from the dropdown widget. The chart will automatically update based on your selection.<br /><br />
