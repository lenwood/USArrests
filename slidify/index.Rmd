### Introduction

With data from the *1975 World Almanac* and *Statistical Abstracts of the United States*, the [USArrests](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/USArrests.html) data set within the R [datasets](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) package brings together 1973 data on Assault, Rape & Murder arrests by state.<br /><br />

Using RStudio's [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) package, I have created an interactive chart to view this data by state.<br /><br />

I chose this data set for the challenge of creating a choropleth, and because the data is easily accessible to R (this package is included in a standard R installation).

### App Instructions

I have created an interactive chart which dynamically updates based on the crime chosen. The chart displays which states have the highest per capita number of arrests for a given crime.<br /><br />

The app will also calculate the average and standard deviation of the distribution that you select.<br /><br />

To use the web app, select a given crime from the dropdown widget. The chart will automatically update based on your selection.<br /><br />

### Urban Population Histogram

The USArrests data set contains one variable which I chose not to include in the app because it is different than the other data types. I'll include it here.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
urbanPop <- c(58, 48, 80, 50, 91, 78, 77, 72, 80, 60, 83, 54, 83, 65, 57, 66, 52, 66, 51, 67, 85, 74, 66, 44, 70, 53, 62, 81, 56, 89, 70, 86, 45, 44, 75, 68, 67, 72, 87, 48, 45, 59, 80, 80, 32, 63, 73, 39, 66, 60)
hist(urbanPop, main="Urban Population", xlab="Percentage of Urban Population", freq=FALSE, col="lightgreen", xlim=c(15, 115), ylim=c(0, 0.03))
curve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(urbanPop), sd=sd(urbanPop)), add=TRUE, col="darkblue", lwd=2)
```
